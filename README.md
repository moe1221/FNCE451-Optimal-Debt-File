I developed an innovative model for calculating optimal capital structure, which diverges from the traditional models taught in academia, including those advocated by renowned finance professor Aswath Damodaran. My model introduces a novel approach by dynamically adjusting the probability of bankruptcy based on the interest coverage within various debt ratings, rather than relying on static probabilities. This adjustment allows for more accurate and nuanced financial analysis, particularly in assessing the impacts of increasing debt levels on bankruptcy risk. The entire project was programmed using advanced financial modeling techniques and is documented comprehensively, making it accessible for further academic scrutiny and practical application.
